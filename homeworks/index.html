           Introduction In this section we’re going to continue fitting regressions to the training data and testing the predictions against the testing data. We’ll include additional continuous variables. We’re also going to add some new elements. In particular, We’ll be using independent variables or predictor variables that are binary or categorical.
We’ll need the same libraries as last week:
library(tidyverse) library(plotly) library(scales) And the same dataset, which includes data on movies released since 1980.

      <div class="article-style">
        
           The last few times we have been talking about using a regression to characterize a relationship between variables. As we saw, by making a few assumptions, we can use either linear or logistic regression to summarize not only how variables are related to one another, but also how to use that relationship to predict out-of-sample (or future) observations.
We are now going to introduce a different algorithm - the kmeans algorithm. This specific algorithm is part of a larger class of algorithms/models that have been designed to identify relationships within the data. This is sometimes called “clustering” or “segmentation”. The goal is to figure out clusters/segments of data that are “similar” based on observable features.

      <div class="article-style">
        
           Tweets, Texts, and Topics, oh my! Lots of press attention (and academic/commercial research) to social media communication, trying to characterize (in the hopes of predicting) behavior and “sentiment.” Many are trying to do this at scale – analyzing the behavior of large numbers of individual users – including using clustering methods to uncover different “types” of users that can be used to understand and predict human opinion and behavior across a wide range of activities and concepts.

      <div class="article-style">
        
           College Admissions: From the College’s View All of you have quite recently gone through the stressful process of figuring out which college to attend. You most likely selected colleges you thought might be a good fit, sent off applications, heard back from them, and then weighed your options. Those around you probably emphasized what an important decision this is for you and for your future.
Colleges see this process from an entirely different point of view. A college needs students to enroll first of all in order to collect enough tuition revenues in order to keep the lights on, the faculty paid, and, in the case Villanova, purchase TWO campuses. Almost all private colleges receive most of their revenues from tuition, and public colleges receive about equal amounts of funding from tuition and state funds, with state funds based on how many students they enroll. Second, colleges want to enroll certain types of students; colleges base their reputation on which students enroll, with greater prestige associated with enrolling students with better demonstrated academic qualifications. The job of enrolling a class that provides enough revenue AND has certain characteristics falls to the Enrollment Management office on a campus. This office typically includes the admissions office as well as the financial aid office.

      <h2><a href="/data-science-site/homeworks/psc4175_hw_5/" >Conditional Relationships</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
           Agenda Conditional data: when a variable varies with respect to some other variable.
How does the value of the outcome of interest vary depending on the value of another variable of interest?
Typically: outcome of interest (dependent variable), Y-axis.
Other variables possibly related to the outcome (independent variables): X-axis
Our tools depend on the type of variables we are trying to graph.
The “gender” gap in electoral politics Conditional variation involves examining how the values of two or more variables are related to one another. Earlier we made these comparisons by creating different tibbles and then comparing across tibbles, but we can also make comparisons without creating multiple tibbles.

      <div class="article-style">
        
           Uncertainty When we calculate a summary statistic in univariate statistics, we’re making a statement about what we can expect to see in other situations. If I say that the average height of a cedar tree is 75 feet, that gives an expectation for the average height we might calculate for any given sample of cedar trees. However, there’s more information that we need to communicate. It’s not just the summary measure– it’s also our level of uncertainty around that summary measure. Sure, the average height might be 75 feet, but does that mean in every sample we ever collect we’re always going to see an average of 75 feet?

           Motivation: How much do turnovers matter? We’re going to work with a different dataset covering every NBA game played in the seasons 2016-17 to 2018-19. I’m interested in whether winning teams have higher or lower values of turnovers, and whether winning teams tend to more often make over 80 percent of their free throws.
